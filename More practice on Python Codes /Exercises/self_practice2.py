# Exercise 2: To-Do List for Weekly Schedule

# This program allows users to create a to-do list for their weekly schedule.
# Users can input activities for each day of the week and the program will store them in a data structure.
# The program also provides a function to display the schedule in a readable format.

# In this exercise, we'll explore more about Python concepts such as list, for loop, and nested loop.

# Step 1: Define the Main Functions

# Start by defining the main functions: input_schedule(), display_schedule(schedule), and main().
# input_schedule(): Prompt the user to input activities for each day of the week and store them in a data structure.
# display_schedule(schedule): Display the schedule in a readable format.
# main(): This is the entry point of your program where you'll call the other functions.


# Step 2: Implement the input_schedule() Function

# Allow users to input activities for each day of the week.
# You can use any data structure to store the schedule, such as lists, dictionaries, or nested lists.
# Ensure that you handle user input properly, providing clear prompts and error handling if necessary.


# Step 3: Implement the display_schedule(schedule) Function

# Display the schedule in a readable format.
# You can choose any format that suits your preference, such as printing each day with its corresponding activities.
