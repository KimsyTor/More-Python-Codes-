# Exercise 3: Grade Analyzer
    
# This program allows users to input grades for multiple subjects and calculates the average grade for each subject.
    
# In this exercise, you'll learn more about list, and nested for loops. 
# You'll also define functions to input grades for each subject and calculate the average grade for each subject.

# Step 1: Define the input score Function
 
# Define a function to input grades for each subject.
# Loop through each subject in the subjects list.
# Prompt the user to input grades for the current subject.
# Return the list containing grades for all subjects.
     
 
# Step 2: Define the average score calculation Function
 
# Define a function to calculate the average grade for each subject.
# Loop through each list of grades in the grades list.
# Calculate the average grade for each subject by dividing the sum of grades by the number of grades.
# Return the list containing average grades for each subject.
