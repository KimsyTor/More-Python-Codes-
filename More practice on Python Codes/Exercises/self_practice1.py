# Exercise 1: Multiplication Tables Generator
    
# This program generates and prints multiplication tables for numbers from 1 to 10.
# The program uses a nested loop to iterate through the numbers and print 
# the corresponding multiplication expressions.
    
# Step 1:  Begin by creating a function called multiplication_tables().

# Step 2: Inside this function, we'll use a double loop. 
#         This means we'll have one loop inside another.

# Step 3: For each combination of numbers from both loops, we'll print the multiplication 
# expression and its result. For example, if the outer loop is at 2 and the inner loop is at 3, we'll print: 2 x 3 = 6

# Step 4: Display the results to the user in a creative way with the function
